# test-fibonacci
My first attempt at setting up a basic project with cmake and googletest, using a simple fibonacci function to experiment with.

Running the script <code>build</code> will generate the necessary cmake files into the <code>src/</code> folder.

The project requires that both cmake and gtest be setup.
